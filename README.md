Implemented the ability to upload video from the file system and by link to a video file (perhaps I misunderstood the essence here and you could expect that there will be an iframe in which your link will be). In the sidebar, you can add notes by time intervals, import and export them.

## Installation

```bash
  yarn install
  yarn start
```
